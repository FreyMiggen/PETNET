# A social networking sites for cat lovers
1. Social Network Site
   PetNet has almost all basic functions of a typical social network app: Newsfeed, Profile, Post, Like, Comment, Follow,  Real-time Chat, Real-time Notifications.
2. Function for recording memories of your cat
   Petnet allows user to create multiples cat accounts, each for one of their cat. A cat profile has basic information such as: name, description, face images, fullbody images. These 2 latter fields could be used in case of wanting to use Find Lost Cat feature in the future.
   Moreover, when user creates a post that associates with one or more cats, images and other information from that post will be automatically updated to those cats image album.
3. Find Lost Cat function
Petnet is envisioned to help cat owners reunite with their missing cats. Cats might have the tendency to wander off.
